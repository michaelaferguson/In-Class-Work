# How Michaela Writes

## Tools
I use my Macbook Pro to write and store all of my documents. I typically use Microsoft Word and always save a second copy to my desktop. I should *probably* invest in a flashdrive, but so far I have gotten by fine without. When I have completed a document, I'll email it to myself to print, then I leave it in my inbox as an extra copy. 

## Process 
When it comes to actually siting down and starting a paper, my process is only consitent in its inconsitency. Usually, I'll handwrite an outline of the major points I'd like to include, then I'll add in details as I'm brainstorming. I definiely am a visual person, so laying out my plan in some sorts helps me, though sometimes I skip this step and purely "free write" my first draft.
