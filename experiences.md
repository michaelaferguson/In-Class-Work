Since I plan to write an instructional piece related to mountain climbing/hiking, I'll give an example now of a field guide I read that worked well and one that did not.
Typically, the ones that work well give direct, precise language about the location, condition, and specs of the area and trail. The author gives insight on what to look out for, good or bad. They provide first-hand knowledge, but in a non-biased way. 
The guides I've read that were frustrating did the opposite, of course. They typically have vague language and details and don't provide much insight on what to actually expect. Sometimes they provide *too* much of their personal experience and can dwell on the negative aspects they faced. Usually it is weather related, which is good to note for the reader, but it might be unlikely that they will experience the same thing. I don't like to read a fully subjective instructional about a trail I just need the specs on.
