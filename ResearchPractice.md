# November 8th: Research Methods
I brought in an article on the future of climate change and its effect on the United Sates, from eos.org: [here](https://eos.org/features/how-will-climate-change-affect-the-united-states-in-decades-to-come)

From that, I grabbed these keywords: emissions, sea levels, climate change, carbon dioxide, global temperature, and greenhouse gases.
Scrolling through your "environment" twitter list is providing some interesting resources and articles.  

After Google searching select keywords, I was lead to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's site, which has a plethora of pie graphs that show America's main sources of greenhouse gases in categories of agricultural, industrial, commercial, transportation, etc. 
Another source that explained more on what greenhouse gases actually are came from the U.S. Energy Information Administration website.
NASA has lotsa cool global maps on their "Earth Observartory" page. 

I plan to write my white paper on something environmental related..probably specifically related to the details of America's big-meat industry and its methane contributions.
