# *Moby Dick*, chapts. 51-68

   I quite enjoyed this section of the novel because I feel like some of the ruminating big ideas are starting to come together. Ishmael’s extended commentary about the physical characteristics of the various whales was thoroughly interesting to me, though I did not fully understand all of the jargon. His explanation about a sperm whale’s eyes was actually quite profound and there must be a parallel to Ishmael’s life somewhere but I have not yet figured out how exactly. Essentially, he says the whale has two “side fronts”, each eye is seeing potentially two *very* different things at all times (179), which could be advantageous or deadly for the whale. I also see it is all parts contributing to the whole, which is what the various crew members are to this ship. 
   ***
   Also, when describing the whales, I noticed Ishmael described from the outside in: he talks of the blubber as a thick wall of skin and moves inward to its brain, the “nut”, which he compares to the “innermost citadel within the amplified fortifications of Quebec” (194), which I thought was beautiful.
Another part that stuck out to me was another mention of Ishmael and Queequeg’s wedded connection. In the chapter “The Monkey-rope”, the two are tied together while Queequeg is descending to cut into a whale and Ishmael comments that if one goes down, they both go; 
 “...for better or worse, we two, for the time, were wedded” (171). 
 ***
  He uses “wedded” to describe the closeness of the situation, but it really takes “til death do us part” to a literal sense here. This situation exemplifies that the two have the most ideal partnership right now on the ship because they are deeply rooted in trust, which strongly contrasts with Ahab, who seems to constantly be on edge or scheming.
