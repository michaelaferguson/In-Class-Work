For this instructional project, I would like to write a field guide on climbing the north face of Longs Peak, a 14er in Estes Park, Colorado, where I am from.  I frequently read mountain field guides and find them interesting, whether I make the climb or not. The route I will give instructions is a less common route, and there are not a lot of guides for it out there. I have lots of personal knowledge about this mountain and would love to write a guide based on my own experience.
