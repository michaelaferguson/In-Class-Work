1. My writing habits, this semester in particular, are not very productive overall. I certainly procrastinate and then sit down and try to do it all in a few sessions before the paper is due. No matter if I'm crunching it in last minute or not, something I've always needed to do is map it out well beforehand. I like to gather all my sources first and have a physical copy if possible to mark on and really dissect before using them for the paper. I also always outline first. It's usually chicken-scratched on a piece of notebook paper, and even if I don't end up following said outline, it really helps me to have some direction before beginning. 
2. I really like the idea of working on a paper everyday even if only for 20 minutes and I want to implement that technique from now on. I have a terrible memory, so I think I've told myself that I have to write in fewer sittings so to keep my train of thought and not totally forget it by the next day. Writing into the next section would benefit me as well in this regard to give myself a little nudge when I sit down again to work on it. 
3. Something I do well is in my resource gathering. So long as I don't need too many sources, I like to have a physical copy of them all, and I think I have an organized method of keeping track and referencing them all by clearly marking what's important from each article. I like to think this saves me time so I don't have to flip back and forth excessively or look for lost web pages.
